mc_rcon_python_library
======================

A python library for talking to a Minecraft server through the rcon

Basically taking other people's code and that the minecraft server has an rcon port and making a library to talk
to it.

I like exploring the world and having to build the same output as I chart new ground all the time was getting
tedious.
